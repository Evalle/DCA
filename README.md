## Quick facts about the exam

  ### Summary
  These are the most relevant quick facts of the exam:

  - The exam is online, using Google Chrome browser on <B>Windows</B> or <B>MacOS</B> ONLY. <B>Linux</B> support IS NOT available at this time;
  - 55 questions to be answered within 90 minutes. Which give you almost one minute and a half to spend on each question;
  - It costs 195 USD or 175 EUR;
  - Lasts for 2 years after the day you got certified;
  - Docker does not publish exam passing scores because exam questions and passing scores are subject to change without notice;
  - Results comes instantly.

  More detailed parts about the exam, please refer to the Links section.

  ### Question format

 There are THREE TYPES of giving answers:
 - ONE RIGHT ANSWER: The answer options will be a clickable spot and you must select ONE CHOICE. This can be either select a valid answer in a true/false statement or a fill in blank example.
 - MULTIPLE ANSWERS: The answer option will be a square-type and accepts MULTIPLE CHOICES. Before checking the answers, please refer to the question to ensure HOW MANY VALID CHOICES ARE.
 - Discrete Option Multiple Choice (DOMC) : Options are randomly presented, one at a time. For each presented option, the examinee chooses YES or NO to indicate if the option is correct. [Sample DOMC Questions](https://sei.caveon.com/launchpad/docker-domc-practice-exam-world-geography/domc-practice).
